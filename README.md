## Requirements
- Windows 10 or Above
- Works on Windows 8.1 but requires [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net472-web-installer) to be installed separately

## FAQ
**1. Why it requires admin permission on execution?<br>**
  - This is due to how windows require elevated execution when adding the necessary firewall policies. If the app is running in normal mode it will not be able to do its operations and will throw errors.

**2. Windows smartscreen detected unrecognized app/publisher<br>**
  - The app requires a registered publisher which costs a lot of money. Rest assured the app is safe and has been tested by several users.

**3. I'm receiving frequent timeouts when a match is being confirmed<br>**
  - You may have blocked many servers, for optimal searching and relaying block only the necessary servers that you don't want to play on

## To Do
- Possible UI refactoring (for now its simple as possible)

## Contributors
- @Mohamad82Bz (for testing out the app on EU Servers and providing necessary details)
